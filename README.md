# CSVtoJIRA
A C# app to quickly convert .CSV files to JIRA tables.

## How to Use
Simply save your Excel worksheet as a .csv file, then pull that file into the program and convert it to a JIRA table. Bing bang boom.

## Future Plans
This probably won't happen, but it'd be cool to have a full table editing program that automatically saves as JIRA tables. This would more likely happen in the form of an Excel macro. I just wanted to do this for C#/VS practice, mostly :)
